# CS2040C
This module introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The module covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary heaps, trees, and graphs), searching and sorting algorithms, basic analysis of algorithms, and basic object-oriented programming concepts.

Done in AY19/20 Semester 1. Taught by Prof Alan, Cheng Ho Lun.

## Code
This repository contains my own implementation of the compulsory Assignments given in the module, as well as Kattis problems done as practice. To my knowledge, all the code should be fully functional and working - Assignments given full credit and Kattis problems accepted. Kattis filenames correspond directly to the problem links.
